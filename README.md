# Secret-Santa

## About

A simple script that utilizes a csv to match participants and notify them via text message

## Getting Started

* Install necessary packages with `yarn install`.

* Setup your csv file with participants and their phone numbers. Copy `sample.csv` to `data.csv` and update accordingly.

* Copy `.env.sample` to a new file, `.env` and update the variables as necessary.

* Once all that is set up, we run it with `yarn start`.

## Future

I hope to one day stick a UI on here such that users can sign up, start private participant pools.
